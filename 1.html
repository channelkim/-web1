  <p>Well, Ali Baba had them forty thieves
  Scheherazade had a thousand tales
  But, master, you in luck 'cause up your sleeves
  You got a brand of magic never fails
  You got some power in your corner now
  Some heavy ammunition in your camp
  You got some punch, pizazz, yahoo, and how?</p>

  See, all you gotta do is <strong>rub that <u>lamp</u></strong>
  <p style="margin-top:5px;">And I'll say
  Mr. Aladdin, sir
  What will your pleasure be?
  Let me take your order
  Jot it down</p>
  You ain't never had a friend like me
  Life is your restaurant and I'm your maitre d'
  Come on, whisper what it is you want
  You ain't never had a friend like me
  <br>Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service
  You're the boss, the king, the shah
  Say what you wish, it's yours! True dish
  How about a little more baklava?
  Have some of column A, try all of column B
